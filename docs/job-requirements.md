# Job Requirements

Please note that all the hashed and stars are part of the markdown language.
My IDEs have markdown viewers.  
Hashes are section titles while stars are bullet points.

Text surrounded by **double stars** are key points.
It's not so much that they have to meet the double star requirements.
But rather, if they do, then they would be a good candidate for learning the rest.
